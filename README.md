# Looking Behind COVID-19 Numbers
Explore Covid 19 data and retrieve maximum information from it. Not just that using that data I am going to build a tableau interface. To showcase information in an interactive way. In this project, we have shown a relation between covid cases and deaths. And through data, we observed that as cases are increasing deaths are increasing. But as vaccination is started death count and cases started decreasing. 


## Primary Goal

Primary Goal with this project was as it is my first project how i can use my all bacis knowledge 
in any project which can challenge me and push my skills. Also as i got tha data find insides of it and tell some story through it.
